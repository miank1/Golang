// Controlled Parallel Execution
// Problem Statement:

// Write a Go program that processes a list of URLs concurrently using a fixed number of worker goroutines (e.g., 3 workers). Each worker should:

// Simulate fetching the URL by printing:
// "Worker X is fetching URL: <url>"

// Sleep for 100ms to simulate delay.

// Once all URLs are processed, the program should exit cleanly.

// âœ… Requirements:
// Use goroutines and channels.

// Ensure all URLs are processed exactly once.

// Use sync.WaitGroup to wait for workers to finish.

// No race conditions or deadlocks.
