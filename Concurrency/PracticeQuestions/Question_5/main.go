// A goroutine simulates doing some work (e.g., sleep 2 seconds and then send "work done" on a channel).

// The main goroutine should select between:

// Receiving the "work done" message.

// A timeout channel created with time.After(1 * time.Second).

// ðŸ‘‰ Expected behavior:

// If work finishes before timeout â†’ print "Received: work done".

// If timeout happens first â†’ print "Timeout! Work took too long".
